The cancel batch should only run on non-blackout days.  Where the cancel effective date falls on a blackout day then the cancellation will be picked up in the batch on the following business day (with the cancel effective date still being PCN+22)

Also once the policy is cancelled an email and letter needs to be sent for which please refer the document attached under Field Specification Document section. Also with the email and letter below needs to be configured:
